<h1>Map Analyst</h1>
<h2>Version 2.6</h2>
If you have own materials/textures, models or sounds in your map,
you have to send these files together with die level file (BSP), so the
player can see your textures and hear your sounds.
<p> 
One can also put the collection of all the needed files into the 
level file (BSP) it self. The Map Analyst 'man' can do the job for you!
</p>
   
<p> 
'man' analyzes HL2 map files and determines all files needed by this map.
This includes materials, textures, sound, models, scripts and so on.
</p>
   
<p> The needed files can automatically be included in the level file (BSP).
</p>

<blockquote>
<i>
Special thanks goes to Gosuke, who had the idea to write this program.
After the first steps many mapper supported me. 
Beside Gosuke, Thomas 'Flausch' Abts, DJ Flyer alias Markus, and Spice are now 
in the famous hall.
<P>
Without there help the Map Analyst would be still beta and many
features were missing.
<P>
THANKS!

<h2>1. Start the Map Analyst</h2>
   <img src="pics/manI2.jpg" align="left">
The zip file can be unpacked at any location.
It is common to put programs in to the folder 'programs'.
Create your sub folder 'man' and unzip the zip file there.
<p> 
After unpacking, there should be the files 'man.htm' (this file) the 
program 'man.exe', and a sub folder 'pics'.
With a double click onto 'man' one starts the Map Analyst.
</p>
   
<p>  <b>
Before you can analyze, you have to set the game path.
</b>
Without a valid game path, 'man' can not find the correct files.
</p>
   
<p> 
In the options menu one have to choose the sub menu 'Game path', and than
select 'Set game path'.
For the game 'Counter Strike' the path could be
'C:\Valve\SteamApps\Gordon Freeman\counter-strike source\cstrike'.
There are folders like 'materials', 'maps', and so on.
 </p>
   
<p> 
For every mod the path is different.
After the path is set the analysis of a map can be started.
With the menu entry 'View game path' the settings can be controlled.
</p>
   
<h2>2. Reading in a map</h2>
     
<table cellpadding="5">
   <tbody>
      <tr>
   <td valign="top"> <img src="pics/manB2.jpg">
   </td>
   <td>               
      <table>
   <tbody>
            <tr>
   <td>The Map Analyst is started with a <b>double click</b>.<br>
            <br>
With the file menu one can choose a map file (VMF or BSP) for reading.
During the reading the content is prepared for the analysis.
The results are shown in the working window. Instead of using the file menu
one can also drag and drop a map file onto the working window.
</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td> <img src="pics/manC2.jpg">

   </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
   <td>                           
<p> 
Alternative one can drag and drop the map file (VMF or BSP) onto the program icon.
But then a different location for the configuration file is used. If you prefer this
method, you have to set the game path again. See also 7. Options.

<h3>2.a Start the Map Analyst from Hammer</h3>
One can start the Map Analyst from Hammer: 
<OL>
<li>Compile the map in 'Expert Mode'.
<li>Make a new command. 
<li>Give the <i>'Cmds'</i> the path of the installed man.exe. 
<li>In the <i>'Parms'</i> line insert <b>-c $bspdir\$file.bsp -g $gamedir</b>.
<li>Let this be the last command.
</ol>
<p>
Each time one compiles the map in 'expert mode' all custom files will be 
inserted into the bsp by MAN.

<h2>3. Analysis of a map</h2>
 
   In the file menu choose <img src="pics/manL2a.jpg">.
<p> <img src="pics/manF2.jpg" align="left">
   </p>
   
<p> 
One after an other all model, sound, material and texture files and 
other game files (bot, text etc.)
are analyzed.
Files not found are colored in blue, file found are colored in black and displayed together with there size.
</p>
<p> Beside the model files ending on '.mdl' all files with the same base name
but suffixes '.dx80.vtx', '.dx90.vtx', '.sw.vtx', '.vvd'
and '.phy' will be taken to the include list.
</p>
   
<p> All material files (VMT), used in the models are analyzed and used texture files (VTF)
are also included.
 </p>
   
<p> After that, the map is analyzed for sound files (WAV), sprites (SPR) and scene files (VCD).
 </p>
   
<p> At last all brushes are analyzed for material files (VMT) and there used textures (VTF)
 </p>
   
<p> If a text file (.txt) or bot file (.nav) exists in the 'maps' folder
they are included too.
</p>
   
<p>  <img src="pics/manG2.jpg" align="right">
All files, not found are now looked up in the HL2 GCF files. The GCF files
contains all materials, textures, models, sound, etc. used in HL2 game levels.
If missing files are not found there, they are displayed in red messages in
the working window. These files can not be includes and not used in game.
</p>
   
<h2>4. Inserting the files into the level file  (VBSP)</h2>
   In the file menu choose <img src="pics/manL2b.jpg">.
<p>   
<table>
   <tbody>
      <tr>
   <td> <img src="pics/manL2.jpg">
   </td>
   <td align="top"> 
All found files are inserted in the level file (BSP/VBSP).
<p> HL2 creates also internal files for game files (BSP) and include them.
All found files and the internal files will be collected and inserted.
If own files of the same name already exists (i.e. one have already included them in the game file), 
they will be over written.
       </p>
               
      <p> If the option 'Overwrite BSP' is not set a copy of the BSP file is made and named 'man_betatest.bsp'
and stored in the 'maps' folder.
If the option 'Overwrite BSP' is set, the level file will be over written.
</p>
               
      <p>During the insertion all files listed on the working window (black color) and marked with 'include'.
If a file already existed in the game file it is marked with 'replace'.
Internal HL2 files are shown in blue colored messages and marked with 'remain'.
</p>
        </td>
   </tr>

<h2>5. Inserting other files manually</h2>
     
<table>
   <tbody>
      <tr>
   <td valign="top"> <img src="pics/manM2.jpg">
   </td>
   <td> 
In the file menu 'Include -&gt; Choose file..' one can choose more files for insertion.
One can choose several file in the file selector box.
        
      <p>
If one want to use these files more then once the file list can be stored
in a TXL file. Just open a file selector box with 'Include -&gt; Save file list..'.
One can name and place the file every were. But if it has the same name as the
game file, it can be used by the Map Analyst automatically.

      </p>
               
      <p> With 'Include -&gt; Read file list..' one can read in the file list.
  </p>
        </td>
   </tr>
         
  </tbody>  
</table>
     
<h2>6. Saving the results</h2>
   <img src="pics/manN2.jpg" align="left">
The list of found files (content list) can be saved in a text file.
<p> The content of the working window can be saved be choosing 'Results..'.
<p> With the new menu entry 'Map Info..' (not shown here) one can generate a
summery of the map and store it as text file.

With 'View game path' one can check the actual setting.

      </p>
      <p>As soon as an option changes the settings are stored 
in the file 'man.cfg'. If 'man' is started with a double click this file is at
the same location as the Map Analyst were stored.
<br>
      </p>
      <p>But if a map or bsp file is dragged and dropped over the program icon
the location is some thing as 'own files'. If one prefer this kind of usage
the game path has to be set again.
