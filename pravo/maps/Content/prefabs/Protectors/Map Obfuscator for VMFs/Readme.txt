WHAT IS THIS?
This removes entity names from your map and helps prevent people from stealing/messing with entities in your map.

HOW DO I USE THIS?
Use IID_GUI.exe, OR:
Drag one or more VMF files onto IID.exe. They will be obfuscated and outputted as oldfilename_omni.vmf.

If you do NOT want entities whose position does not affect their performance to be repositioned then pass input files with command prompt and put -norepos BEFORE the name of the file(s). You can open a command prompt here by right clicking the background of this folder while holding Ctrl and Shift and choosing Command Window here.

PARAMETERS:
[All parameters only affect files passed after them]

-norepos
Disables repositioning of position-independent entities.
